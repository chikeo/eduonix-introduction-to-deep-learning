# Eduonix Introduction to Deep learning
Introduction to Deep Learning Webinar organised by Eduonix and delivered by Dr. Darshan Ingle

## Setup
There is no setup or configuration needed as the computation environment utilised here was a cloud one, the Google Colaboratory (aka Google Colab), a cloud-based Jupyter-Notebook style python computation environment.
The Google Colaboratory has most artificial intelligence (AI) python libraries preinstalled so that all you will need to do is to import
the library that you need in your notebook. However, you might want to ensure that you have the latest version of `pip` package installer for Python using the command below before commencing any work.
Please note that this command is already included in the notebook and you do not need to do this separately.

`pip install --upgrade pip`

### Getting Started

#### Clone this Repo
`git clone git@github.com:chikeo/eduonix-introduction-to-deep-learning.git`

#### Navigate to Google Colab
Open up your favourite browser (preferrably Googe Chrome) and navigate to https://colab.research.google.com/.

#### Upload
Select the `Upload` tab and click on `Choose file` to navigate to 
where your working clone of the repo on your local machine.

If you cannot find the `Upload` tab because you have escaped the dialog with the tabs and are currently at the `Welcome to Colaboratory` intro notebook at https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb, 
you can still upload the `Eduonix_Predict_Whether_a_Patient's_Diagnosis_of_Breast_Tissue_is_Malignant_or_Benign.ipynb` notebook by selecting the menu `File` > `Upload notebook`.

#### Run the Jupyter Notebook
Having opened up the Jupyter Notebook in the previous step, you can now execute all the Python code in the Notebook by selecting the menu
`Runtime` > `Run all`

> Note: If you want to run the Notebook interactively, you can click or tab into each cell and do `SHIFT+ENTER` until you get to the last cell.
